        "*   **Reddit**: Discussions regarding what happens during events also occurs on the forum platform Reddit. We collected relevant Reddit threads to each event, where we include both the original submission and subsequent comments within those threads.\n",
        "*   **News**: Traditional news agencies are often a good source of information during an emergency and so we have also included a small number of news articles collected during each event as well.\n",
        "*   **Facebook**: We collected Facebook/Meta posts from public pages that are relevant to each event using CrowdTangle. We cannot share the content of these posts, however, we have included the post and page ids of this content within the stream for those who have access to the CrowdTangle API and can retrieve this data separately.\n",

        "*   **unixTimestamp**: This is the time that the content was originally posted, expressed as a unix timestamp in seconds (UTC timezone).\n",
